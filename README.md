## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v16 or higher

- Optional: e621 API credentials for `/e621`

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

   git clone https://github.com/username/puro-discord-bot.git
   cd puro-discord-bot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   clientId=your_bot_client_id
   E621_USERNAME=your_e621_username

   > `E621_USERNAME` and `E621_API_KEY` are only required for the `/e621` command.

4. **Configure the bot**:
   Edit `config.yml` to customize colors, messages, limits, and other settings. Example:

   status:
     texts:
       - "Powered by Skypixel‚Ñ¢Ô∏è"
       - "Ready to help ‚ù§Ô∏è"

## Usage

1. **Invite the bot**:

   - Grant permissions to read/send messages, embed links, and manage messages.

2. **Use slash commands**:
   - Type `/` in any text channel to see available commands.
   - Example: `/help` for all commands, `/flip 5` to flip five coins.

3. **Interact with events**:
   - In the configured guild, send greetings like "hi" or "hello" for a wolf-themed reply.
   - The bot sets its status automatically on startup.

## Troubleshooting

- **Bot not responding**:
  - Check permissions.
  - Verify `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `clientId` in `.env`.
  - Ensure commands are registered (re-run `npm start`).

- **e621 command failing**:
  - Confirm `E621_USERNAME` and `E621_API_KEY` in `.env`.
  - Channel must be NSFW for explicit content.

- **Greetings not working**:
  - Check the guild ID in `config.yml`.
  - Ensure the message matches a greeting pattern.
