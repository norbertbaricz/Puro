### Events

Puro listens and responds to various Discord events:

- **Ready**: Logs startup details and sets a custom status (from `config.yml`).
- **Interaction Create**: Handles slash commands and button interactions.
- **Message Create**: Responds to greetings (e.g., "hi", "hello") in a configured guild with customizable replies.
- **Custom Events**: Easily add your own event handlers.

> Optional AI moderation example: `events/ai.js` demonstrates an on-message moderation check using a local Ollama server. If you want to enable it, update `CHANNEL_ID`, `MODEL`, and `OLLAMA_API_URL` at the top of that file and ensure the server is running. If you don't need it, you can delete or ignore that file.

---

### Configuration

All commands and events are fully customizable via `config.yml`:

- Set custom colors for embeds (global and per-command).
- Define messages for success, errors, and interactions.
- Configure cooldowns, limits, and bot status.
- Customize greeting patterns, responses, and more.

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v16.9+ (Node 18 LTS recommended)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- A Discord bot token ([Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
- Optional: e621 API credentials for `/e621`

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/puro-discord-bot.git
   cd puro-discord-bot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add:
   ```
   TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
   clientId=your_bot_client_id
   E621_USERNAME=your_e621_username
   E621_API_KEY=your_e621_api_key
   ```
   > `E621_USERNAME` and `E621_API_KEY` are only required for the `/e621` command.

4. **Configure the bot**:
   Edit `config.yml` to customize colors, messages, limits, and other settings. Example:
   ```yaml
   status:
     texts:
       - "Powered by Skypixel"
       - "Ready to help ‚ù§Ô∏è"
     type: "Custom"
     url: "https://example.com/"
   ```

5. **Run the bot**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

---

## Usage

1. **Invite the bot**:
   - Use the bot's invite link (generate in the Discord Developer Portal).
   - Grant permissions to read/send messages, embed links, and manage messages.

2. **Use slash commands**:
   - Type `/` in any text channel to see available commands.
   - Example: `/help` for all commands, `/flip 5` to flip five coins.

3. **Interact with events**:
   - In the configured guild, send greetings like "hi" or "hello" for the configured reply.
   - The bot sets its status automatically on startup.

## Configuration Details

The `config.yml` file is the heart of Puro's customization. Key sections include:

- **colors**: Define global and per-command embed colors.
- **limits**: Set constraints like max message length, coin flips, etc.
- **commands**: Customize messages, colors, and settings for each command.
- **events**: Configure event-specific settings, such as greeting patterns.
- **status**: Set the bot's activity and status type.

Example command configuration:
```yaml
commands:
  love:
    color: '#FF69B4'
    messages:
      self_love: "üíù No self-love checks!"
      error: "‚ùå Error calculating love!"
```

### Command Registration

On startup, the bot automatically registers all valid slash commands it finds under `commands/` as global application commands. This can take a few minutes to propagate. If you prefer guild-only registration during development, adapt the call in `app.js` to use `Routes.applicationGuildCommands(clientId, guildId)`.

### Ephemeral Replies (Discord.js v14)

Discord.js deprecated the `ephemeral: true` option on interaction responses in favor of flags. The codebase now uses `flags: MessageFlags.Ephemeral` (or `64`) for ephemeral responses. If you add new commands, prefer:

```js
await interaction.reply({ content: 'Only you can see this', flags: 64 });
```

or, when deferring:

```js
await interaction.deferReply({ flags: isPrivate ? 64 : undefined });
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Bot not responding**:
  - Check permissions.
  - Verify `TOKEN` and `clientId` in `.env`.
  - Ensure commands are registered (re-run `npm start`).
  - Note: environment variable is `TOKEN` in this project (not `DISCORD_TOKEN`).

- **e621 command failing**:
  - Confirm `E621_USERNAME` and `E621_API_KEY` in `.env`.
  - Channel must be NSFW for explicit content.

- **Greetings not working**:
  - Check the guild ID in `config.yml`.
  - Ensure the message matches a greeting pattern.

- **AsyncEventEmitter memory leak warnings**:
  - The project increases listener limits on the client and shards to suppress benign warnings from the Discord.js websocket layer. This is expected and safe.

- **database.json issues**:
  - On boot, `database.json` is auto-created if missing and auto-healed if empty/corrupted (a backup is written when possible).

---

## Changelog (recent)

- Migrate ephemeral responses to `flags: MessageFlags.Ephemeral` for Discord.js deprecation compliance.
- Raise max listeners on client/shards to avoid benign AsyncEventEmitter warnings.
- Auto-create/repair `database.json` on boot for smoother first-run and recovery.
